# Terminology

## Features

In Geonames a feature is basically any geographical feature that's been given a name. That's incredibly wide ranging; a feture might be:

* A country
* A county or state
* A town, city or village
* A mountain or mountain range
* A river, lake or stream
* A railway station

## Feature Classes

Features are broadly divided into feature classes, which are single letters:

* **A** country, state, region,...
* **H** stream, lake, region,...
* **L** parks, area,...
* **P** city, village,...
* **R** road, railroad
* **S** spot, building, farm
* **T** mountain, hill, rock,...
* **U** undersea
* **V** forest, heath,...

## Feature Codes

Features are also divided by feature codes, which are essentially sub-divisions of feature classes.

Here are some examples:

* **A** country, state, region,...
    * **ADM1** A first-order administrative division; for example a country
    * **ADM2** A second-order administrative division; for example a county or state
* **P** city, village,...
    * **PPL** A populated place; e.g. a city, town, village
    * **PPLC** A capital city
* **S** spot, building, farm
    * **RSTN** A railway station
* **T** mountain, hill, rock,...
    * **MT** A mountain
