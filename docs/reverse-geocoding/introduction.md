# Reverse Geocoding

Geocoding is the process of converting a place - for example an address or city - and converting it into geographical co-ordinates; usually latitude and longitude.

Say you're building a "Find my nearest Store" service; you'd typically find the user's location as a latitude and longitude, then use a proximity search to find their nearest store; in order to do so you'd need the latitude and longitude of all of the stores.

Reverse geocoding is, as you might expect &mdash; the opposite. You may know that your user's location is 51.5074° N, 0.1278° W; that's fine for some uses, but it's also useful to know where that is. (It's London, if you're interested).
